# 🌍 Earthquake Prediction Project

## 🚀 Welcome to the Earthquake Prediction Project!
Hey there! This project is all about using AI to predict earthquakes based on seismic data. If you love playing with data, machine learning, or just want to contribute to something cool, you're in the right place! 🎉



## 🔥 Why This Project?
Earthquakes are unpredictable, but what if we could use machine learning to get an estimate? This project leverages **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models** to analyze seismic data and predict possible earthquakes. 



## 🚀 Features
- Uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) over RNN for improved time-series forecasting 📊
- Predicts earthquake occurrence based on historical seismic data 🔍
- Visualizes predictions with an interactive web-based frontend 🌐
- Scalable and adaptable for future improvements ⚡


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Here's what powers this project:
- **Backend:** Python (Flask)
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database:** MySQL/PostgreSQL
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
